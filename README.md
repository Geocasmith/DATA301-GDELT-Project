# DATA301Project
Using the GDELT Online Summary API and multiple regression to answer the question: What is the relationship between the price of bitcoin and the number of mentions of bitcoin in the global news and the tone of the articles that mention it?
I have attatched the .ipynb file and a pdf of the report I wrote corresponding to the code.

How to run:
If you wish to run the project, you can run it from the google colab link given below. 
Inside of the google colab notebook, click (Runtime -> Change runtime type) then change the hardware accelerator to GPU. Click save. Then click (Runtime -> Run All). This will take a few minutes to install the NVIDIA RAPIDS before it can run.
